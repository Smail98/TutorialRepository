### Terms to Know 
1. Secure Socket Shell (SSH): used for sending text files 
2. Port 22 in SSH: utilizes encryption
3. Standard File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) :      known as Secure Socket Shell, and this 
                                                 sets up files that get automatically updated
                                                 in the afs server. the S in front of FTP means 
                                                 that encryption is used. In order for encryption
                                                 to be used, Port 22 was selected
4. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) :       does not use encryption. and as a result Port 21 is used when 
                                        selecting a host 
5. HTTP: hyper text transfer protocol 
6. HTTPS: secured hyper text transfer protocol 
7. ICAN: runs Domain Name Server (DNS)
8. Hierarchy of servers: there is a layer of DNS servers before the ICAN server can be reached 
9. Software Protocol: an agreement on something being done. 
10. Browser and functions: 
    
    
    * browsers are used to connect to the web browser
    * Browser sends the requests, 
        1. get    : request to get a webpage
        2. post   : post new records
        3. put    : make updates
        4. delete : delete 
        5. patch  : update selectively 

Roy Fielding's Dissertation

Describes how the internet can be used as agiant database with Representational State Transfer(REST). The reason for 
using the internet as a giant database is to make it easier to share information around the world. REST was used as a 
guide to design and develop the architecture of the modern Web[1]. REST was used in the design of Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol and Uniform Resource Indentifier standards from their deployment in Web client and server software.
